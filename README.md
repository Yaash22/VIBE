🎵 VIBE – AI-Driven Music App (Work in Progress)

Welcome to VIBE, an experimental project where we aim to build a music app without writing code—just using AI tools! 🎶

🚀 What is VIBE?
VIBE is an ambitious attempt to leverage AI to design, develop, and deploy a functional music application. Instead of traditional programming, we explore no-code AI tools, automation platforms, and AI-driven app builders to bring this idea to life.

🔍 What We’re Exploring
AI-based App Builders (e.g., Adalo, Bubble, or Glide)
AI Music Recommendation Engines
Generative AI for Personalized Playlists
Voice & Chat AI for User Interactions
No-Code Backend Services

🛠 Current Progress
We’re still in the Prototype phase! If you’re interested in AI, music, or no-code development, we’d love for you to join us in this journey.

🤝 How to Get Involved
We welcome AI enthusiasts, no-code builders, musicians, and designers to contribute ideas, experiment with tools, and help shape VIBE!

🔹 Share AI tools or techniques you think can help
🔹 Collaborate on testing & prototyping
